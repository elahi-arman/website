      <h1>The Cost of Cutting Class</h1>

      <article>
        <p>
          I can empathize coming back to school is tough, especially with
          COVID-19 looming over our heads, TikTok occupying most of our heads,
          and the ever-present dread that comes with the end of school seemingly
          on the horizon. When I was in my first year of university, I often
          skipped class.
        </p>

        <p>
          There was one particular class that took attendance on a sheet of
          paper. I suckered one of my friends into going and writing my name
          down to make it seem like I was there. I attended maybe 40% of that
          class and managed to pass. But somewhere in that quarter, my brother
          sat me down for a math exercise. He asked
        </p>

        <blockquote>"Do you know how much cutting class costs?"</blockquote>

        <p>I didn't know. So we sat together and did the math</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Assume tuition is $50,000 (whether from your pocket or someone
            else's) per year.
          </li>
          <li>Each school year is made of 3 quarters.</li>
          <li>Each quarter, a full-time student takes 20 units.</li>
          <li>
            For every 4 unit class, you're in class for about 30 hours (3 hours
            / per week over 10 weeks).
          </li>
          <li>That means each class costs about $100.</li>
        </ul>

            (I like to call it the cancelling of units) that gives us an
            equation that ends in $ / class.

        <p>
          Sometimes, you'll find that it was worth it, but remember your
          full-time job is to be a student. That means learn and absorb
          knowledge at least 30 hours per week.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you get to the work place, you won't have that luxury. You
          <em>might</em> get 2 hours per week <strong>on the job</strong> if
          you're lucky. If you're unlucky, that means you have a full-time 40+
          hours per week job and a side gig where you could be burnt out.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, if you're thinking of cutting class or worse, not paying
          attention, I hope you've got $100 to spare.
