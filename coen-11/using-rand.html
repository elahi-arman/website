      <h1>Generating Random Numbers</h1>

      <article>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This page should teach you enough to be able to generate random
          numbers in C. It's short because there really isn't too much to using
          random numbers. This page assumes you know how to write code in a
          C-ish language as well as how to write a Hello World C Program.
        </p>

        <h2>Generating a Single Random Number</h2>
        <pre>
            <code>
            // import standard library functions
            #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
            #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; 
            #include &lt;time.h&gt;

            int main() {
                srand(time(NULL)); 
                int random = rand(); 
                printf("Random number: %d", random);
            }
            </code>
      </pre>

        <p>
          The snippet above generates a random number between 0 and RAND_MAX and
          then prints it out. The funciton call <code>rand()</code> does the
          actual number generation. So if that's the most important line, what's
          all the rest of the code?
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to correctly use
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library"
            target="_blank"
            >standard library functions</a
          >, you need to include the proper header files. The ones I included
          give (1) <code>printf</code> (2) <code>rand, srand</code> and (3)
          <code>time</code>. If you don't include these, in most cases the
          functions <em>should</em> still work but they'll be declared as
          <code>int func();</code> instead of their correct declaration.
        </p>

        <p>
          There's a secret about <code>rand()</code>: it's
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_generator"
            target="_blank"
            >pseudo-random</a
          >. In order to get a string of random numbers, we call
          <code>srand()</code>. If you don't call it, then the pseudo-random
          string will be seeded with the value of 1. Every time you use the same
          seed, you get the same set of random values. Try taking out the srand
          line, compiling the program, and then executing the program. You
          should get back the same set of random numbers every time.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we seeded the pseudo-random number generator with the same value on
          every compilation, we'll get back the same set of random numbers. So
          to make the values unique on every run, we must get a new number every
          time we run the program. That means we can't give a value at compile
          time and we can't use rand to seed the value either since the unseeded
          rand will be the same for every compilation. One easy way to get a
          unique number on every run is to use the current time!
        </p>

        <p>
          UNIX timestamp is stored as an integer that's counting the number of
          seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch. The Unix epoch is
          <time datetime="1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"
            >00:00:00 UTC 1 January 1970</time
          >
          (an arbitrary date). If you run the command <code>date +%s</code> in
          your terminal, you can see the current UNIX timestamp. Every second,
          it'll increment, so that gives us a unique number (as long as the
          program isn't run in the same second). To get the UNIX timestamp, we
          can use the <code>time()</code> function. We're not going to go into
          the <code>NULL</code> just yet though since we haven't gotten to that
          material.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that should explain all the nitty gritty details of that code,
          excluding the presumed knowledge of C and printf.
        </p>

        <h2>Changing the bounds of the number</h2>

        <p>
          Getting a number between 0 and RAND_MAX is a lot. But there is a way
          to add bounds to a given number. If you want to set a lower bound, you
          can add to whatever value is returned from <code>rand()</code>
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code>
          int random = rand() + 6
          </code>
    </pre>

        <p>
          Now, the bounds are 6 and RAND_MAX + 6. First
          <code>rand()</code> generatets a number between 0 and RAND_MAX, then
          we add 6 to the value. And if we want to set an upper bound we can use
          the modulo operator <code>%</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          Modulo gives the remainder of a division operation. So if you do
          <code>x % 5</code>, this is guaranteed to give you a number between 0
          and 4. Hopefully this is enouogh to convince you that the modulo
          operator always returns a number from 0 to X-1. You can start to tsee
          the repetition for yourself, but I'm not going to drag it out too
          long.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>0 / 5 = 0, remainder 0</li>
          <li>1 / 5 = 0, remainder 1</li>
          <li>2 / 5 = 0, remainder 2</li>
          <li>3 / 5 = 0, remainder 3</li>
          <li>4 / 5 = 0, remainder 4</li>
          <li>5 / 5 = 1, remainder 0</li>
          <li>6 / 5 = 1, remainder 1</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          So to give both a lower and an upper bound, you can use the
          combination of <code>+</code> and <code>%</code>. In this next bit of
          code, we'll get a random number between 6 and 16.
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code>
          int random = (rand() % 10) + 6
          </code>
    </pre>

        <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Write a function which takes in 2 integer parameters, upper and
            lower bound, and returns a random number between the boundaries. You
            can assume the pseudo-random number generator has been seeded.
