        These pages are a first draft. There are definitely spelling errors and
        some rambling. If you have improvements or kudos, feel free to email me.
        I haven't tested the code snippets yet, I was mainly trying to get some
        thoughts and code examples down.

        Welcome to Debugging, one of the things you wish they would have taught
        you in school but realize they didn't. The really smart students know
        problems, the really talented students find problems.

      <h2><a href="./process.html">The Process of Debugging</a></h2>
      <p>
        Ever wondered how to start finding problems in code? This page describes
        my methodology of debugging. Fair warning, it takes about 20 minutes to
        get into but it hasn't failed me yet.

      <h2><a href="./printing.html">Debugging using Print Statements</a></h2>
      <p>
        Print debugging is the first step into seeing your program's logic play
        at hand. This is usually people's first foray into debugging and it's
        pretty solid. When you're just starting to figure out issues, printing
        is an amazing way to get a lot of data to help you
        <em>narrow down</em> where your problem is.

      <h2><a href="./debuggers.html">Using the Browser's Debugger</a></h2>
      <p>
        Once you've decided to mature into adulthood, we'll discuss how to use
        any debugger. Most debuggers have the same set of base capabilities
        regardless of what language you're debugging. We'll go through the basic
        functions of a browser's debugger and see how they play well together.
