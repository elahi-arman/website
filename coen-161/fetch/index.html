            This page goes over some practical applications with the fetch
            function. This page is focused on giving insight into fetch() calls
            and patterns. CORS will be a whole other page, so we won't go over
            those sorts of issue.
          </p>

          <h2 id="what-is">What is fetch?</h2>
          <p>
            Fetch is <em>generally</em> used as a function to make HTTP requests
            from JavaScript. The Fetch API does more than just making HTTP
            requests using the
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch"
              target="_blank"
              >fetch function</a
            >, but when referring to fetch, I've seen people mainly refer to the
            function itself. The
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API"
              target="_blank"
              >entire API</a
            >
            is written into a browser's JavaScript engine. The Node.js engine
            doesn't include this API, but you can npm install the non-standard
            node-fetch library to bring fetch functionality to servers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fetch function is used to make HTTP requests after the page has
            been loaded. For some webpages, a single HTML page is the entire
            content. We wouln't use fetch to load a webpage like that. But
            suppose, your page has to request 30MB of data. If you attached this
            data to the HTML page, your page would take a long time to load.
            Instead, we can send an initial, incomplete page and then request
            the additional data using fetch.
          </p>

          <p>
            Aside from loading data, you may send additional HTTP requests to
            submit or update data on a server without using a
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement"
              target="_blank"
              ><code>form</code></a
            >. Although HTML forms are a proven way to send data to a server,
            they do cause a full page reload so it looks a little janky when
            making small incremental changes to data on a server. If you had to
            reload the page everytime you changed from light to dark mode on a
            page, it could get a bit annoying.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <h2 id="using-fetch">Using Fetch</h2>
      <p>Here's the most simple way to:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Make an HTTP request using fetch</li>
        <li>Parse the response</li>
        <li>Use the response.</li>
      </ol>

      <pre>
          <code>
          fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')    // make an HTTP request using fetch
              .catch(error => console.log({error}))  // handle server unreachable
              .then(response => response.json())     // parse the response  
              .then(data => console.log({data}))     // log the response
          </code>
    </pre>

      <p>
        First, fetch some JSON data from the http://example.com server. The
        fetch function returns a Promise that will either:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          resolve with
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response"
            target="_blank"
            >an object that represents an HTTP request</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          reject with a <code>TypeError</code> if there was trouble reaching the
          server.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        When there's an error which makes the server unreachable when the server
        can't be reached either for a
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors"
          target="_blank"
          >CORS issue</a
        >
        or a network error. In this case, we log the error, which is not really
        useful to end users but it's enough for now. This is written in the
        <code>.catch()</code> statement on the second line.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fetch function doesn't directly return a body because not all HTTP
        requests return a body. Sometimes only the HTTP status code is sent back
        because that's not enough to convey the result. If you a server sends a
        404 response, clients know that HTTP server didn't find the requested
        resource so parsing the body is unnecessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this simple example, we'll assume the request either doesn't connect
        to the server or is returned a JSON body. To extract and interpret the
        body of an HTTP request, the fetch API provides a few methods. For our
        class, we'll most likely only need to interpret JSON responses, so the
        response.json function will be enough.
      </p>

      <h2 id="get-requests">Making GET Requests</h2>

      <p>
        If you want to get a bit fancier and interpret the server's response
        correctly, you can check the headers that are sent back. In this next
        example, we will:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Call the fetch function with to the URL "/161/fetch/echo"</li>
        <li>
          Once the server has started responding, check if the response is okay
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>If the response is okay</li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              if the server tells us this is JSON data, interpret the body as
              json
            </li>
            <li>in all other cases, interpret the body as text</li>
          </ol>
          <li>
            if the response is not okay, return a rejected Promise with the
            status code
          </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Once we've interpreted the body, log the data</li>
      </ol>

      <pre>
          <code>
          fetch("/161/fetch/echo")
            .then((response) => {

              // use the response.ok property (a boolean to check the status code)
              // is between 200 and 299
              if (response.ok) {
              
                  // check the headers of a response by using the response.headers
                  // property. to retrive the value of a single header, use the 
                  // response.headers.get method
                  if (response.headers.get('Content-Type') === 'application/json') {
                      return response.json()
                  } else {
                      // if the response isn't meant to be viewed as json, interprett
                      // itt as text
                      return response.text()
                  }
              } 
              
              // when the response is not between 200 and 299, return a rejected 
              // promise with the status code. By returning the rejected promise, we
              // will trigger the next .catch() in the chain.
              return Promise.reject(response.status)
            }).then((data) => {
                console.log(data)
            })
          </code>
    </pre>

      <p>
        Reviewing this code block, here's a couple of things that we've learned
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use <code>response.ok</code> to check if the status code is between
          200 and 299, that it was a successful response
        </li>
        <li>
          Use <code>response.headers</code> to check the value of headers from
          the server
        </li>
        <li>
          Use <code>response.json()</code> when we should interpret the body as
          json
        </li>
        <li>
          Use <code>response.text()</code> when we should interpret the body as
          plain text
        </li>
        <li>
          Use <code>Promise.reject(response.status)</code> to call the next
          <code>.catch()</code> in a Promise chain.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If your response isn't JSON, you may want one of these other methods to
        extract the body:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <code>response.formData()</code> - when the body is form-encoded data
        </li>
        <li><code>response.text()</code> - when the body is plain text</li>
        <li>
          <code>response.blob()</code> - when the body is binary data (like an
          image or video)
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        All three of these functions and response.json() return a Promise that
        will resolve only once the <strong>entire body</strong> of the HTTP
        response has been read. We can't use
        <code>JSON.stringify()</code> because the Promise returned from
        <code>fetch()</code>
        is resolved as soon as the server responds with headers. Since the HTTP
        response may be sent back in multiple small chunks, use the above
        functions so you don't have to handle the code to reassemble the small
        chunks.
      </p>

      <h2 id="errors">Handling Fetch Errors</h2>

      <p>
        What sorts of errors do we have to deal with and where? Because each
        <code>.then()</code> has its own set of errors, we'll start by dealing
        with the errors from each <code>.then()</code> independently.
      </p>

      <pre>
          <code>
          fetch("/161/fetch/echo")
          .catch((networkError) => {
            // this block of code is only called when the server could not 
            // be reached
            console.log('Could not connect to server, please try again later', {networkError})
            
            // add an error state to prompt the user to try again
            document.querySelector('#submit-button').classList.add('error')
          })
          .then((response) => {
            if (response.ok) {
                if (response.headers.get('Content-Type') === 'application/json') {
                    return response.json()
                } else {
                    return response.text()
                }
            } 
            
            return Promise.reject(response.status)
          }).then((data) => {
            console.log(data)
          }).catch((serverError) => {
            // errors handled by this catch block will have all reached the server.
            // so either the response.json() went wrong or the Promise.reject() was
            // called. If the response.json() went wrong, we'll get aa 
            if (serverError instanceof SyntaxError) {
                console.log('Server sent back malformed JSON')
                // add a disabled state because the server isn't sending back the correct format for JSON.
                document.querySelector('#submit-button').disabled = true
            } else {
                console.log()
                if (serverError === 400) {
                console.log('Server did not accept our request')
                // add a disabled state because we aren't sending correct requests
                    document.querySelector('#submit-button').disabled = true
                } else if (serverError === 404) {
                console.log('Server did not find the resource')
                document.querySelector('#warning').textContent = "Couldn't find any data"
                } 
            }
          })
          </code>
    </pre>
      <p>In this code block, we used:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A .<code>catch()</code> between the call to <code>fetch()</code> and
          the first <code>.then()</code> to isolate any network errors
        </li>
        <li>
          A <code>.catch()</code> after receiving a response to 400/500
          responses
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Use the <code>if (serverError instance of SyntaxError)</code> to
            check for JSON errors
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the the <code>statusCode</code> to identify other types of
            errors.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Part of Web Development's reality is its unreliability. You can trust
        neither clients nor servers so you'll be writing a lot of error checking
        code. By splitting up the errors into two catch blocks, we isolate which
        errors we deal with when. This makes our functions smaller and easier to
        understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although error handling is important, we won't be including error
        handling in most examples. Error Handling is solved on a case by case
        basis, so writing generic solutions won't be too helpful without large
        examples.
      </p>

      <h2 id="cleaning">Cleaning Fetch Code</h2>

      <p>
        That last code block got quite long so, I like to collapse the following
        utility functions for readability.
      </p>

      <pre>
          <code>
            const handleResponse = (response) => {
              if (response.ok) {
                if (response.headers.get('Content-Type') === 'application/json') {
                  return response.json()
                } else {
                  return response.text()
                }
              } 
              
              return Promise.reject(response.status)
            }
                
            const logData = (data) => {
              console.log(data)
            }
          </code>
    </pre>

      <p>
        In most servers that you create, you'll start to identify the patterns
        that you like to code with so keeping around a function like this is a
        very good idea.
      </p>

      <h2 id="#post-requests">POST Requests</h2>

      <p>
        If you want to create data on a server, we should be sending a POST
        request. It's not much different from sending a GET request. The main
        change is that we'll be using the second parameter of
        <code>fetch()</code>:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>set the request method</li>
        <li>tell the server we're sending json data</li>
        <li>send json data</li>
      </ol>

      <pre>
        <code> 
          // assume this endpoint receives any HTTP request method
          fetch("/161/fetch/echo", {
            // tell the browser to send a POST request
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
            // tell the server we are sending JSON
            'Content-Type': "application/json"
            },
            // we can't transfer a raw Object, only
            // Buffers or Strings so stringify
            // the object before sending it off
            body: JSON.stringify({ id: "arman" })
          }).then(handleResponse).then(logData)
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        The <code>fetch()</code> call has some very good defaults, like
        defaulting to a GET request, so the first example didn't require setting
        up any non default options.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any of the things we'd do with a GET response, we can do with a POST
        response. We can similarly change the method from POST to PUT or DELETE
        as long as the server is okay with it.
      </p>
