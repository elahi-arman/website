          Have you shared a link and it almost looks sketchy? It shows up just
          as a little gray bubble. You see the preview and just a little gray
          bubble appears with no information.

          Why doesn't it expand like reputable sites? It feels like I may be

          really a liink.

        How do I make that link preview beautiful?
      </h1>
      <p>
        When GUIs like iMessage or Twitter or even Facebook encounter webpages,
        they download the page in the background. If your webpage includes
        certain HTML tags, those applications interpret the tags to show a
        richer preview of a link.
      </p>
      <p>
        Facebook created the
        <a href="https://opengraphprotocol.org/" target="_blank">
          Open Graph Protocol
        </a>
        to turn a webpage into a
        <quote> &quot;rich object in a social graph&quot; </quote>. By inserting
        <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of a
        document, you can annotate your webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get the richer link previews, you need to add 4 tags to your HTML.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <!-- Source = https://opengraphprotocol.org/ -->
        <code lang="html">
          <!-- Title = The title of the Webpage-->
          <meta property="og:title" content="The Rock" />
          <!-- 
            Type = The type of content being displayed. There's only certain
            values that can be shown here
          -->
          <meta property="og:type" content="video.movie" />
          <!-- URL = The url thsi content can be found at (without any redirects)-->
          <meta property="og:url" content="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/" />
          <!-- 
            Image = An accompanying image which complements the webpage. Maybe something
            like a movie poster or a random stock image or a meme.
          -->
          <meta property="og:image" content="https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/rock.jpg" />
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2 id="why-use-open-graph">
        Why should we respect Facebook's Protocol?
      </h2>
      <p>
        You don't have to, but any technology which can preview links will show
        your link as a dingy gray bubble. There was one notable competitor,
        Twitter Cards. But personally, I think their downfall was in the naming.
        They also used <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags but prefixed them with
        <code>twitter:</code>. Why would I add Twitter specific tags? Does that
        mean if a new Social Media platform comes on, I'd have to adopt their
        tags? Seems like a lot of work. Oh but the Open Graph tags are open, so
        anyone can use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get your links to show up properly on Twitter, you need one more tag:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code lang="html">
            <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        One slight but different is that Twitter users the
        <code>name</code> property but OpenGraph uses the
        <code>property</code> property.
      </p>

      <h1 id="dangers">Should I always use a link preview?</h1>
      <p>
        Like all things in Computer Science, it depends. Although we don't know
        the specifics of how each proprietary link previewer works, there could
        be bugs in the code that generates a link preview. What if the preview
        downloads an entire webpage and that webpage is 50GB? That's a lot of
        data. What if the webpage leaks sensitive information? You don't really
        know what you're getting when iMessage decides to show a link preview.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd hope that no link previewers execute any JavaScript that's included
        in a page. The OpenGraph specification is pretty strict on which tags
        are meaningful, but people are smart. With the proliferation of these
        rich links, I can almost guarantee that something bad will happen.
