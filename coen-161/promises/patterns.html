        This page is not a good resource if you haven't fully understood the
        previous two pages. You might find some benefits, but make sure you have
        a good understanding of especially the Promise syntax as we'll be taking
        advantage of it quite heavily.
      </aside>
      <p>
        This page is meant to help you write more legible Promise based code and
        to help you do more complex promise based tasks. Like all things in this
        class, it boils down too functions. Functions aren't just a tool for
        code reuse, they give a name to a block of code

        <h2>1. Multiple Independent Promises</h2>
        <aside>
          <header>ℹ️ TL;DR</header>
          Use <code>Promise.allSettled</code> to wait on multiple independent
          Promises to finish before continuing execution.
        </aside>
        <p>
          One of the beautiful parts of JavaScript is that the hard problem of
          scheduling multiple things at once are not your problem. JavaScript
          delegates long running tasks to the Operating System (OS) through
          asynchronous functions from the JavaScript environment.

          On the

            >previous page</a
          >
          we went through an example where we synchronized two promises:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, we tried to read a file using <code>fs.readFile()</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Then we printed out the contents in a separate <code>.then()</code>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This is an example of two <em>dependent</em> promises. The first
          promise is rersponsible for reading the file and the second is
          responsible for printing the contents. You cannot print out the
          contents without first reading the file. We use
          <code>.then()</code> to make sure the execution happens in ordere.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what if we don't care about the order of Promises, we just want
          too knowo when all the Promises are done. Let's consider the case of
          reading a directory of HTML files and replacing every
          <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag with <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>. To accomplish
          this task, we could:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Read the directory of HTML files using <code>fs.readdir()</code>
          </li>
          <li>Loop through each file in the directory</li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Verify the file is an HTML file (maybe by using the file
              extension).
            </li>
            <li>Read the contents of each HTML file.</li>
            <li>Find and replace each <code>&lt;i&gt;</code></li>
            <li>Write each file with the replaced tags</li>
            <li>
              After everything is done, print out the number of times in each
              file a replacement was made sorted from most to least.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Before jumping into code, let's see which steps depend on each other.
          1 <em>must</em>
          be finished before anythinig else happens. So all steps from 2 onwards
          must happen in the chain of Promises following 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each file is independent. We don't need to wait for the first file to
          finish writing to start working on the second file. Each file is doing
          its own thing. But the reading, replacement, and writing of a single
          file must all happene in sequence. Printing the number of replacements
          must be done after <em>all</em> Promises are done because we have to
          sort them.

          With our very succinctly named directory, we call
          <code>fs.readdir</code>. I've added a <code>.catch()</code> so you can
          see an example of error handling. I also used an arrow function just
          for brevity.

          This is some nice synchronous code. I like to make a lt of new
          variables because they let me update the names of things as I go. If
          you're worried about performance of creating a new array, remember
          that this probably takes nanoseconds to execute. Your CPU can spare a
          few cycles to make the code easier to read.

          You might have previously returned after the <code>fs.readFile</code>,
          but we won't be doing that. If we returned inside this loop, we would
          only read the firstt file. Our next step here is to wait for the file
          to finish being read and once we have the contents, we can replace and
          then write out the new contents.

          Now our function is getting complex. I assigned each Promise to a
          variable. Even though variables may be unused, it'll help us keep
          track of Promises.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once the OS has finished <code>readHTMLFile</code>
          <em>then</em> JavaScript will count and replace all the tags,
          synchronously. After that, JavaScript tells the OS to execute the
          <code>rewriteHTMLFile</code> Promise. Once the OS has written the
          file, <em>then</em> the <code>tagsReplaced</code> are returned.

              </summary>
              <p>
                The value of <code>tagsReplaced</code> is available, but we want
                our program to finish <em>successfully</em> writing the files
                before any other Promise uses the <code>tagsReplaced</code>.
                What if one of the files fails to write? We need to communicate
                that.

              <p>
                Since the first <code>.then</code> returns the
                <code>rewriteHTMLFile</code>Promise. So adding another
                <code>.then</code> will get the return value of
                <code>rewriteHTMLFile</code> The return value of the
                <code>rewriteHTMLFile</code>will be whatever is returned from
                the <code>.then</code> attached to the
                <code>fs.writeFile</code> call. What's returned from that call?
                <code>tagsReplaced</code>
                which is a number.

                This is all just a roundabout way of saying that Promises return
                whatever is in the <em>final</em> <code>.then</code> in the
                chain of Promises

              <p>
                It currently returns undefined, as a Promise. So you can still
                use a
                <code>.then</code> to synchronize additinal Promises, but it
                doesn't currently output a value.

              <p>
                Not as it's written here. Because we don't assign
                <code>fs.readFile</code> to a variable, the value of that
                Promise cannot be accessed. Anyone who tries to add a

                <strong>ONLY</strong> ever retrieve the last value in the chain.

          Some of them are explicitly declared, others are not. As much as it's
          important that a computer can understand your code, it's more
          important for humans to be able to understand your code.
          <strong>Code is meant for reading, not writing </strong>. So make sure
          your code is readable. How do we make this code more digestible?
          There's one simple trick, use functions. Functions are not only a way
          to reuse code, they help you name code.

          Why is this code a bit more readable? We have distinct places to look
          for bugs. Each function is separate from any other. We can verify that
          the <code>printReplacements</code> function works without testing the
          <code>replaceTags</code>. And most of all, the synchronization of
          Promises is separate from the logic. Each function may or may not
          return a Promise, but by wrapping the execution of the callback
          function in <code>.then()</code>, we guarantee each function becomes
          asynchronous. That's one less point of variability in our function, we
          don't have to worry about whether code will be synchronous or
          asynchronous.

        <h2>3. Racing Promises</h2>
        <p>
          In some cases, you may want to have multiple Promises race against
          each other. You want to know when at least one of the Promises is
          either fulfilled or rejected. This
          <strong>will not cancel</strong> any of the Promises. This technique
          will only be useful for the program listening. If you're make 2
          requests to a server and want only one of them to execute, this is not
          the correct pattern. You'll want to synchronize the two Promises.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Once a Promise is started, it cannot be cancelled </strong>.
          There are libraries that will help you ignore values, but remember
          that HTTP is stateless so any two requests are not dependent on each
          other. So what food is this pattern if you can't tell a server to
          cancel a request?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's think about loading states. On a web page, humans will think a
          <a
            href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/"
            target="_blank"
            >web page is fast if any user action gets a response within 100ms</a
          >. But what happens if you request some data from a server but it
          takes more than 100ms? You still want to show something, and that
          something is often a loading state. We won't get into what loading
          states should look like, but we can get into how to race loading
          states. Because if the server responsds within 100ms, then you
          probably don't want to show a loading state.
        </p>
        <p>
          So one of the problems that racing Promises can help you solve is to
          only display a loading state if an operation (in this case, making a
          request to a server) is slow.
        </p>
        <pre id='ex-promise-race' data-line="20-21">
          <code>
            const setElementContents = (elementContents) => {
              document.querySelector('.content-to-be-loaded').innerText = elementContents;
            }

            const makeRequest = (url) => {
              return fetch(url).then((elementContents) => {
                return elementContents;
              });
            };
            
            const useLoadingState = (time) => {
              return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                setTimeout(() => {
                  reject(makeLoadingState);
                }, time);
              });
            };
            
            const getElementContents = makeRequest('my-server')
            Promise.race([getElementContents, useLoadingState(150)]).then(setElementContents);

        </pre>
        <p>
          This code has a lot of things that are just glossed over, namely the
          mechanics of each function. But we use
          <code>Promise.race</code> to set the contents to winner of the race.
          Since race will always resolve regardless of if the winning Promise
          fulfills or rejects, we don't nede to have a <code>.catch()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because we don't want to show a loading spinner forever. We will queue
          up the getElementContents for whenever it's ready. This is safe to do
          twice because once a promise fulfills or rejects, the value will never
          change.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>Promise.race</code> does have a sibling called
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any"
            target="_blank"
            ><code>Promise.any</code></a
          >
          which only resolves once on of the given Promises <em>fulfills</em>,
          so it waits until one of the requests succeeds. If your Promises only
          every <em>fulfill</em> or you want to make code wait for the first
          <em>successful</em> response then <code>Promise.any</code> is more
          suitable.
